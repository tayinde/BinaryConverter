# BinaryConverter
## Run
You will need the [.NET Core CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed to your system to run this program.<br>
When the CLI is installed, you can simply type `dotnet run` in the root directory of the project.
## Other Information
Currently, the program supports ASCII values 0, 255. Values outside of that will not give correct results, however, eventually all ASCII characters will be available for converting to binary.
